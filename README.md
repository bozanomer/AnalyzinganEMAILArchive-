# Analyzing an EMAIL Archive 


I have a huge e-email archive and are gonna make an brief analysis on it. Dr.Chuck  Charles Russell Severance is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information provided us for this dataset.This is the list of e-mails he has received over the years.Our question is here which word is used much more in this mail list  and top 10 Organizations mails number according to years.

All the process related to process is told in README.txt. I just want to show visualizations from here.

## Which word was used more by over years in the e-mails?

There is a simple vizualization of the word frequence in the subject lines in the file gword.py.This produces the file gword.js which you can visualize using the file
gword.htm.

Right here, we can see the "Sakai" is the most used word,because in 2007, Dr. Chuck resigned from his position as the Executive Director of the Sakai Foundation, becoming Clinical Associate Professor of Information at the University of Michigan. 

Sakai is a free, community source, educational software platform designed to support teaching, research and collaboration. Systems of this type are also known as Course Management Systems (CMS), Learning Management Systems (LMS), or Virtual Learning Environments (VLE). Sakai is developed by a community of academic institutions, commercial organizations and individuals. It is distributed under the Educational Community License (a type of open source license).
## Which top 10  organizations  by has Dr.Chucj recieved e-mails according to years? 

A second visualization is in gline.py.  It visualizes email participation by organizations over time.Its output is written to gline.js which is visualized using gline.htm

On the visualization, it can be easily seen which organizations has sent more e-mail and which organization's e-mail number is decreased as time goes.This shows top 10 organizations and we can say that people are always tend to used their personel account in project progress, that is why "gmail" is in the top 10 list as an organization.
Finally, Here the total number of e-mails by per organizations:
