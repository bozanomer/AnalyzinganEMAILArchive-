# Analyzing an EMAIL Archive 


We have a huge e-email archive and are gonna make an brief analysis on it. Dr.Chuck  Charles Russell Severance is a Clinical Professor at the University of Michigan School of Information provided us for this dataset.This is the list of e-mails he has received over the years.Our question is here which word is used much more in this mail list  and top 10 Organizations mails number according to years.

All the process related to process is told in README.txt. I just want to show visualizations from here.

## Which word was used more by over years in the e-mails?

There is a simple vizualization of the word frequence in the subject lines in the file gword.py.This produces the file gword.js which you can visualize using the file
gword.htm.
